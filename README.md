### Hi there 👋

- 🌱 I’m currently learning AI-related concepts, and from time to time I publish AI-related articles over in the [Raising AI](https://medium.com/raising-ai) publication on Medium
- 📖 You can find other blogs I've written in my [author archives](https://michelle-96669.medium.com/) over on Medium
